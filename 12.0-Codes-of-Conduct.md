## Examples of Codes of Conduct
A lot of work has been done recently to make community conferences safer and more inclusive by outlining a Code of Conduct, or expected behavior for attendees. Having a code of conduct in place helps communicate to prospective speakers, sponsors, and attendees that you intend to provide an environment that ensures an enjoyable and beneficial conference experience for everyone. 

Here are some examples:
- [PyCascades 2019](https://2019.pycascades.com/code-of-conduct/)
- [Vermont Code Camp](https://www.vtcodecamp.org/conduct)
- [Microsoft Reactor spaces](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/reactor/CodeOfConduct)
