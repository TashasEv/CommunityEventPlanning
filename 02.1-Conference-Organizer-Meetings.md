Yes, you have to have meetings.

The frequency and format of the meetings is up to the whole team really, but they should be on a **set schedule.** It's important to create a pulse for the team to sync themselves against. 

The main point of such meetings is to plan, assign tasks, report task progress, and make group decisions if the need arises. It's best to have a meeting agenda ahead of time, and to assign a team member to enforce the meeting agenda.

Meetings certainly do not have to be in person, and it's possible that your organizing team may be spread out. Viable meeting formats include:
* Conference Calling
* Google Hangout
* Skype
<<This is obviously out of date. What are the kids using to do calls/video conferencing these days?>>

For your meetings, it's a good idea to have a web-based group space to organize thoughts, tasks, and materials. Some ideas for this space include:
* Trello
* Google Docs
* a shared OneNote file
* Slack

Note that not all of the options for meetings and online space listed above are free. However, sometimes making an investment in these will making planning for the next event that much simpler by maintaining historical data.
