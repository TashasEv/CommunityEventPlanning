## Conference Formats
There are many different ways to hold a local tech event. Below is a brief description of each type of event, with plans for a deeper dive for each type in their resepctive chapters.

### Code Camp/Tech Saturday/BarCamp?  
Code Camps and "Tech" Saturdays are arguably some of the oldest and most common tech community conference formats. While there are events that refer to themselves as Code Camps that do not adhere to this model, in this context a Code Camp/Tech Saturday event refers to one which follows these tenets: 
- Must be free or low cost to attendees (low cost meaning covering the cost of food for example)
- Must not be promotional in nature
- Conference content should be community generated
- In general, the event happens on a Saturday (there are notable exceptions to this)

### GiveCamp/Charity Hackathon  
### Bootcamp
### Hackathon/ThinkTank/Dev Challenge  
### Virtual Conference
### Unconference

    - to have or not to have sponsor sessions  
    - alternative session ideas like lightning talks
