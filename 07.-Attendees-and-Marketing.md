- How to find attendees
- How to register attendees 
- What % of attendees should you expect to show up
    - Free event
        -Rule of thumb, you can hope for 10%-50% of people showing up or less. It's really important in that case to show the value of your event to people to make sure they will take the time to be there.
    - Paid event
        -If people pay to enter the event, depending on the price, a lot more people will come. Making people pay means more qualified people, but fewer of them in the beginning. Keep in mind the price of the ticket will influence the % of people showing up. Of course showing the value (what's in it for the participant) is key to have a maximum of people.
